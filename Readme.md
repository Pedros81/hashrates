# Hashrate reports

Use this repo to report your hashrates. This is useful for setting up a mining calculator that computes your combined CPU+GPU hashrate for Warthog's Janushash algorithm.
## There are two files;
```
.
├── sha256t.csv          <-- insert your sha256t (GPU) hashrate here
└── verushash2_2.csv     <-- insert your verushash (CPU) hashrate here
```
